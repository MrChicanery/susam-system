We welcome you to explore the many offerings of our programs, courses, and degrees here in the State University System of America. The reputation of a university is, in large part, measured not only by the excellence of its faculty and students but, importantly, by the quality of its academic programs. Through its chosen faculty members, the State University System of America offers programs of the highest quality.

Our catalog is intended to provide information and resources to those interested in graduate education programs at the State University System of America. Our catalog is for our current students as well to assist them in making the best decisions for maintaining and continuing their academic progress while on the way to their professional and personal goals.

Good luck,
Kayla M. Chicanery
Head of the SUSAM System
Secretary of Education
