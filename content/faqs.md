So I know alot of yall hate education, so ima try to explain my thoughs behind it here.

Q: What is the purpose of education?
A: To give the people knowledge on both basic things they need to know, and things they can use to help the country.

Q: Where does the money come from?
A: Dorms, Food, Advertizing and International Students. My goal is net-positive on the education system.

Q: Where do we get teachers?
A: We can pay them, and we can have PhD students teach them for free (as PhDs will cost money since a thesis defense is EXPENSIVE)

Q: Why so many colleges?
A: Public image mainly. But also, its to promote learning across the whole country.

Q: I can't afford college!
A: We are making college tuition free for citizens upto the end of a Bachelors degree.

Q: Will colleges promote any political party?
A: No. Never. The education system is fully nonpartisan. No woke agenda, and no jim-crow stuff. Some classes may be taught from a certain perspective, but that decision is made by teacher and not by me. The exception is that I wonâ€™t allow any ISIS propoganda or anything like that.

Q: Whats the point of an English class?
A: You need to know how to write to be a lawyer, politcian, or a businessman.

Q: Whats the point of Calculus?
A: Say I'm trying to calculate the number of rails I need. I can do this with algebra, or calculus. Calculus is way more efficient. I don't mean hard calculus - I mean basic baby derivatives, limits, and integrals (unless you really want to take harder classes).

Q: Aaron Miles?
A: He's chill.

Q: Are you basing this off of any IRL systems?
A: As much as I can. We have part of SUNY, a department from UF, etc.

Q: Where do I sign up?
A: I'm working on that.
